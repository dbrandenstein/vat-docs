# Python Library

The Geo Engine Python Library allows users to interact programmatically with a Geo Engine backend, for instance the one offered in the Semantic Layer.It allows the management of a Geo Engine instance for administrators, for example to assign roles.
Users can manage their datasets, layers and workflows and load data products into Python for further processing and analysis tasks.
Having data products from the Geo Engine easily available directly in Python facilitates their use in external tools users are already working with.
For example, the Geo Engine Python Library can be used in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to construct and retrieve data products from a Geo Engine backend, taking advantage of Geo Engine's powerful geospatial processing capabilities.
Then, with a data product loaded into Python, any suitable visualization tool can be used within the notebook.
Furthermore, when connected to the same Geo Engine backend, a user can seemlessly switch between the Geo Engine web front end (VAT) and the Geo Engine Python Library, choosing the tool best suited for the task at hand any time.

## Getting started

To become familiar with the Geo Engine Python Library, take a look at the examples in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geo-engine/geoengine-python/tree/main/examples).
You can connect to the Geo Engine backend running in the Semantic Layer.

## User Guide

In addition to the [examples](https://github.com/geo-engine/geoengine-python/tree/main/examples), which offer a good starting point, there also exists [documentation](https://python.docs.geoengine.io/) for all available functionality.

## Developer Guide

The source code of the Geo Engine Python Library is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/geo-engine/geoengine-python).
