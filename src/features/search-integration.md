# Search Integration

The VAT system provides a search integration with the [GFBio search](https://search.gfbio.org/) that allows users to transfer search results directly to the VAT system.

## Searching for data

Users can filter the search results by selecting _Visualizable in VAT_ in the menu on the left side.

## Adding layers to the map

This will open a dialog in the VAT system where users can select the layers they want to add to the map.
Users can choose the layers they want to add and if they should replace the current layers or add the new layers on top of the current layers.

The selected layers will be added to the map in the VAT system.
Users can now work with the data as they would with any other data in the VAT system.
