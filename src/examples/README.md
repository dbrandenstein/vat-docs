# Examples

This chapter contains examples of how to use the VAT system.
The examples are written in Jupyter notebooks and are available in the [`examples`](https://github.com/umr-dbs/vat-docs/blob/main/src/examples) directory.
The notebooks are converted to markdown and included in the user documentation.

**++ Currently, the examples are being reworked after the latest update because GBIF behaves differently now. [Find out more](/updates/updates_and_changes.html). ++**
