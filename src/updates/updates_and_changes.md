# Updates & Changes

#### ++ 19.06.2024 ++

- **Login improvements**: We have improved the login experience by fixing a bug where the login state was displayed incorrectly as well as by implementing an automatic authentication refresh mechanism which keeps your login session active for longer, requiring less frequent logins.
- **Introduction of GBIF Time:** We updated the GBIF data provider, so it now supports the time-component of the GBIF data. This way the user can benefit from spatio-temporal data, leveraging the strength of spatio-temporal visualization, analysis and transformation of the VAT.
- **Quantile calculations:** We added the option to calculate quantiles when editing the symbology of a raster layer. This allows you to create breakpoints of gradient colorizers adjusted to the underlying data distribution in addition to creating evenly spaced breakpoints between minimum and maximum values.
- **Color Scales:** We added many new color maps to the symbology editor, expanding the readily available options for data visualization.
