# Updates & Changes

#### ++ 27.06.2024 ++

- **Login improvements**: We have improved the login experience by fixing a bug where the login state was displayed incorrectly as well as by implementing an automatic authentication refresh mechanism which keeps your login session active for longer, requiring less frequent logins.
- **Introduction of GBIF Time:** We updated the GBIF data provider so he now supports the time-component of the GBIF data. This way the user can benefit from spatio-temporal data, leveraging the strength of spatio-temporal visualisation, analysis and transformation of the VAT.
- **Quantile calculations:** We added the option to calculate quantiles when editing the symbology of a raster layer. This allows you to create breakpoints of gradient colorizers adjusted to the underlying data distribution in addition to creating evenly spaced breakpoints between a minimum and maximum values
- **Color Scales:** We added many new color maps expanding the expression possibility of the user.
