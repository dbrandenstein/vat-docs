# Introduction

### Welcome to the VAT Documentation

The VAT documentation is the first point of contact for VAT-related questions. Therefore, this documentation first covers the basics of the system in the Background section and then the functionality with examples in the User Guide section. This documentation also provides relevant links to find the resources to answer your questions.
